# Job Search Bot

By default, running jobsearchbot.py will expect bot_config.txt to exist in the same directory. 

## Config Setup

### The config file should contain the following information:
- search url
- minimum # of matching keywords needed
- number of pages to look through
- keywords to look for
(seperate via comma).

The bot_config.txt file contains an example config setup.
